# [Missing number](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/top-interview-questions-easy/99/others/722/)

So this one is pretty simple, calculate the sum of all integers below len+1, then subtract each element from this value and you should be left with the missing value.
O(n) time complexity, O(1) space complexity.

Absolutely no idea how it shows I am only faster than 8% of submissions, since apparently everyone else used the same methodology??
