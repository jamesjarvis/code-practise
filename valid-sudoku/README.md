# [Valid Sudoku](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/top-interview-questions-easy/92/array/769/)

I chose to simply check the vertical, horizontal and chunks using maps (so O(n) space), but combined these all into a single O(n^2) pass rather than 3 different passes.
Apparently as fast as any other approach, and uses less memory, so idk what other people were doing?
