# Binary Tree Array

Full disclosure, I basically took this from this fantastic stackoverflow result:
https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/237019/parsing-binary-tree-array-in-python

The main PITA was the fact that the binary tree is represented as an array, but it makes sense now going depth by depth.
